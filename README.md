Groestlnodes is a fork of bitnodes is currently being developed to estimate the size of the Groestlcoin network by finding all the reachable nodes in the network. The current methodology involves sending [getaddr](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#getaddr) messages recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network, starting from a set of seed nodes. Groestlnodes uses Bitcoin protocol version 70001 (i.e. >= /Groestlcoin:2.10.x/), so nodes running an older protocol version will be skipped.

See [Install guide](https://github.com/Groestlcoin/groestlnodes/wiki/Install) for steps on setting up a machine to run Groestlnodes. The [Redis DB schema](https://github.com/Groestlcoin/groestlnodes/wiki/Redis-DB-schema) contains the list of keys and their associated values that are written by the scripts in this project.
